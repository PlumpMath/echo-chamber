(DONE) 1) Simple app protocol. Tutelage works with the protocol
2) Investigate usefulness of intent dispatcher with another sample app
  i) As one point of reference, ripping off the missing intent handler from util for tutelage now.
  ii) Additionally, the multimethod impl for handling multiple intents is tedious at best.
3) Schemas for request and response objects, figure out where validation occurs
4) Document/tests
